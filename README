This is the old landing page for Honolulu Hackerspace, done using the Yii Framework.

The code was not done cleanly, nor was it intended for public consumption, so go through the config file carefully.

You will need PHP 5 and MySQL (since the dump file provided is MySQL) but it is possible to convert it to PG or another.

Run the install script, set up the DB, set the config file(s) as specified, point your web root to the web folder, and that should be it!
